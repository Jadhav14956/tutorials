Use tables
	chatting with a student
	saw a code snippet that used a table
	asked if he could change it to use two <ul>
	would style it using CSS to resemble a table
	tables were old school

Is there a use for tables?
	MDN definition says they are used to present two dimensional tables
	First thing that comes to mind are charts and two dimensional lists

Where did all the hate come from?
	Back in the day, tables were used for formatting and layout purposes
	With the advance of CSS and properties such as float, we don't need to use tables as a hack

Table layouts will still be around in the foreseable future
	Email clients are more varied and older than Web Browsers
	Email clients have less support for certain CSS styles
	Tables provide a way for consistent display/layout
